/*A positive integer number is said to be a perfect numberif its positivefactors, including 1 (but not the number itself), sum to the number. 
For example, 6 is a perfect number because 6=1+2+3. Write a program that prints all perfect numbers smaller than or equal tosome integerm (m > 1) input by the user. 
Note:Assume that x and y are two positive integers. 
Then x is a factorof y if the remainder of the division of y by x is 0. For instance, 5 is a factor of 15, but not of 36. */
