/*Write a program that prints backwardsa seven-digit positive integer.
For example, if the integer is 9806593, the program should print 3956089.  
You are not allowed to use any function of C standard library other than scanf() and printf(). 
You are not allowed to use arrays either. For the case when the integer ends with 0, the number printed cannot have leading 0â€™s (Eg: input 3412400; output 42143).
Hint: Use the division and remainder operators to separate the number into its individual digits.b)Modify your program so it prints backwards any positive integer, 
not necessarily a six-digit one.  */
